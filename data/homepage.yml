  title: "About me"
  desc: |
    I'm a certified AcroYoga International teacher who fell in love with AcroYoga due to its playfulness, physical challenge, and community.
    Specialising in standing acrobatics and Icarian games, I find it crucial to focus on the basics in order to progress in a safe, sustainable manner.
    I'm a huge nerd about technique and love breaking down tricks into their finest details. 
    While I primarily base, I never say no to fly a hand-to-hand or two!
